## Planning, Design & User Experience

I approached the planning & design of this project using the principles of User Experience and the 5 stages of strategy, scope, structure, skeleton & surface. This is a large, complex project and I wanted to make sure it remained on course, on time and the best it could be whilst meeting all of the criteria for the MVP (Most Viable Product). 

### Strategy

#### Project Aims

The initial aims of the project were to create an e-commerce website for an imaginary company called Posh Portables, a gaming company who stock a variety of gaming accessories, such as laptops, monitors and headgear. The website's main purpose is to allow customers to browse the company's products and make purchases, tell the customers about Posh Portables and information about their online shop and allow user interactions through reviews and messages.

#### Research

I did some research into other similar websites as well as in the wider e-commerce world. I wanted to make sure that the Posh Portables' website conformed to the expectations that users have for an e-commerce site. This is extra important because it involves financial transactions and I wanted to create a feel of trustworthiness and professionalism in order to encourage users to make purchases. I also gathered design ideas for the look of this site including colour, layout and typography.

Websites visited for research:
- [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)
- [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/africa_en/)
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/PC-Accessories/b?ie=UTF8&node=318813011)
- [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/pc-gaming/pc-gaming-hardware/pcmcat159700050051.c?id=pcmcat159700050051)

#### User Stories

### Scope

I then created a list of all the features I would like to add to the site in order to meet all these user stories, as well as some extras that I'd like to include should time allow. I rated these in terms of difficulty and importance and this would help inform the decisions throughout the next stages of planning.

### Structure

#### Flow Diagram

I created a flow diagram using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to map out the structure of the site. This was an important step in the user experience design process, working out the structure and skeleton of the site, to provide the best user experience whilst keeping the user stories at the heart of the decision-making process. It allowed me to think through the paths of users through the site and what would need to link to where based on the different user stories. It would also allow me to make sure the site functioned as expected and everything was easy to find. It was also a vital tool to manage the scope of the project during the design and development stages, a blueprint to keep everything on track.

### Skeleton

#### Database Schema

An important stage in the planning was building a database schema, as well as planning my data clearly from the beginning to make the development process as easy as possible. This database schema was informed by my work in the previous planes, the user stories, the scope chart and the flow diagram. I used [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to create a visual representation of the database, which I used throughout the development process to keep track of what my database looked like, updating it and amending it as the project grew and adapted.

#### Models

Below is a breakdown of all the models included in the final app. The site uses a relational database model using Postgres (SQLite & Elephant SQL). The app uses a number of models adapted from the Boutique Ado walkthrough (User, Email, UserProfile, Category, Product) as well as 3 original models (Faq, Review, Message).

<details><summary>User / Email Models (Created by Django allauth)</summary>

The User model is created by Django allauth and connects to a separate Email Address Model. I have created relationships to these models throughout the project but as I have not created them myself I have not included a breakdown of the fields. More information about Django allauth can be found [here](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/index.html).

#### Wireframes (see below)

Whilst traditionally wireframes are included in the Skeleton section I have included mine in the Surface section below. I have developed a way of working where I flesh out the full design of the site in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), including making all colour, typography and layout decisions at this stage, to make sure that during development I am free to focus on the nuts and bolts of how to build the site, rather than getting distracted by design decisions at that stage. It has been successful for me in the past and so I have chosen to develop the site in this way again.

### Surface

#### Wireframes

At this point I was able to bring together all the work I had done in creating the flow diagram (which included a lot of page content and structure decisions), my user stories, my scope chart and my database schema to create full visual designs for my site. This was more than just making colour and font choices however. Every design decision creates questions about what goes where, what colour should it be, does it even need to be there or would it be better somewhere else. I was able to ask informed questions at each stage to make sure the design reflected the user stories and site aims. E.g. What does a user need to see when they arrive on a page? What is the most important thing on a page and how can the design emphasise that? etc.

I created the designs below, making sure that all pages would work just as well on mobile and tablet as on desktop devices.
