## Planning, Design & User Experience

I approached the planning & design of this project using the principles of User Experience and the 5 stages of strategy, scope, structure, skeleton & surface. This is a large, complex project and I wanted to make sure it remained on course, on time and the best it could be whilst meeting all of the criteria for the MVP (Most Viable Product). 

### Strategy

#### Project Aims

The initial aims of the project were to create an e-commerce website for an imaginary company called Posh Portables, a gaming company who stock a variety of gaming accessories, such as laptops, monitors and headgear. The website's main purpose is to allow customers to browse the company's products and make purchases, tell the customers about Posh Portables and information about their online shop and allow user interactions through reviews and messages.

#### Research

I did some research into other similar websites as well as in the wider e-commerce world. I wanted to make sure that the Posh Portables' website conformed to the expectations that users have for an e-commerce site. This is extra important because it involves financial transactions and I wanted to create a feel of trustworthiness and professionalism in order to encourage users to make purchases. I also gathered design ideas for the look of this site including colour, layout and typography.

Websites visited for research:
- [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)
- [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/africa_en/)
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/PC-Accessories/b?ie=UTF8&node=318813011)
- [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/pc-gaming/pc-gaming-hardware/pcmcat159700050051.c?id=pcmcat159700050051)

#### User Stories

Based on my research and the project aims I created a set of user stories that would inform all the choices made in designing and developing the site. For more details information on the Tasks involved in creating these user stories, please refer to my [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/pecheylauren02/projects/5).

### Scope

I then created a list of all the features I would like to add to the site in order to meet all these user stories, as well as some extras that I'd like to include should time allow. I rated these in terms of difficulty and importance and this would help inform the decisions throughout the next stages of planning.

### Structure

#### Flow Diagram

I created a flow diagram using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to map out the structure of the site. This was an important step in the user experience design process, working out the structure and skeleton of the site, to provide the best user experience whilst keeping the user stories at the heart of the decision-making process. It allowed me to think through the paths of users through the site and what would need to link to where based on the different user stories. It would also allow me to make sure the site functioned as expected and everything was easy to find. It was also a vital tool to manage the scope of the project during the design and development stages, a blueprint to keep everything on track.

### Skeleton

#### Database Schema

An important stage in the planning was building a database schema, as well as planning my data clearly from the beginning to make the development process as easy as possible. This database schema was informed by my work in the previous planes, the user stories, the scope chart and the flow diagram. I used [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to create a visual representation of the database, which I used throughout the development process to keep track of what my database looked like, updating it and amending it as the project grew and adapted.

#### Models

Below is a breakdown of all the models included in the final app. The site uses a relational database model using Postgres (SQLite & Elephant SQL). The app uses a number of models adapted from the Boutique Ado walkthrough (User, Email, UserProfile, Category, Product) as well as 3 original models (Faq, Review, Message).

<details><summary>User/Email Models (Created by Django allauth)</summary>

The User model is created by Django allauth and connects to a separate Email Address Model. I have created relationships to these models throughout the project but as I have not created them myself I have not included a breakdown of the fields. More information about Django allauth can be found [here](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/index.html).

#### Wireframes (see below)

Whilst traditionally wireframes are included in the Skeleton section I have included mine in the Surface section below. I have developed a way of working where I flesh out the full design of the site in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), including making all colour, typography and layout decisions at this stage, to make sure that during development I am free to focus on the nuts and bolts of how to build the site, rather than getting distracted by design decisions at that stage. It has been successful for me in the past and so I have chosen to develop the site in this way again. 

---

### Surface

#### Wireframes

At this point I was able to bring together all the work I had done in creating the flow diagram (which included a lot of page content and structure decisions), my user stories, my scope chart and my database schema to create full visual designs for my site. This was more than just making colour and font choices however. Every design decision creates questions about what goes where, what colour should it be, does it even need to be there or would it be better somewhere else. I was able to ask informed questions at each stage to make sure the design reflected the user stories and site aims. E.g. What does a user need to see when they arrive on a page? What is the most important thing on a page and how can the design emphasise that? etc.

I created the designs below, making sure that all pages would work just as well on mobile and tablet as on desktop devices.

## Business Model and Web Marketing

### Social Media Marketing

As part of the e-commerce website requirements, I made a Facebook Business Page to advertise Posh Portables as a company. Posh Portables is not a real business, however the implementation of a Facebook Business Page aids in webmarketing of the brand which is really important for real business models. Webmarketing is an important process of marketing a business online, and using social media is often cost effective and efficient for brand exposure. 

You can find a link to my Facebook Business Page [here](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61554694944684), however incase the page is taken down at the time of your viewing, please find screenshots below. 

<details><summary>Facebook Business Page</summary>
<img src="media/docs/facebook_1.png">
<img src="media/docs/facebook_2.png">
<img src="media/docs/facebook_3.png">
</details>

### Email Marketing

This project also implemented an email marketing strategy through MailChimp, which is a free platform that allows websites to send emails to their customers, if their customers subscribe with their email address.

I kept the form simple with only an email address section, so users would be more likely to subscribe, and this will allow Posh Portables to send their customers promotions, special packages and more.

<details><summary>Facebook Business Page</summary>
<img src="media/docs/facebook_1.png">
</details>

Perhaps for future business endeavours, it would be beneficial to use other more popular social media platforms, such as Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, as well as paid advertising to ensure Posh Portables shows up in search engines. 

### Business to Customer Model

This e-commerce site is considered a B2C (Business to Customer) model, because it would typically sell gaming accessories directly to customers. Advantages include:

* Being cost effective and easy to set up
* Reaching a wide audience over time
* Direct opportunities to interact with customers

### Search Engine Optimization

More of the results of SEO can be seen in the TESTING.md document, however from a business perspective, SEO was considered an important part of promoting Posh Portables. Keywords were added to meta tags with relevant references to the business, such as "gaming accessories, Posh Portables, pc gaming monitors" etc. 

Additionally, headings were placed in <strong> tags, which increases SEO on google search engines. 

### Robots.txt and Site Maps

The robots.txt file serves as a set of instructions for web crawlers, indicating which pages or sections of a website should or shouldn't be crawled or indexed. In the context of an e-commerce site, it's essential to have a well-optimized robots.txt file to ensure search engines focus on the most relevant and important pages. This can enhance the site's visibility in search engine results and contribute to better rankings for key product pages.

On the other hand, the sitemap.xml file acts as a roadmap for search engine crawlers, providing a list of all the pages on the Posh Portables site that I wanted to be indexed. A comprehensive and up-to-date sitemap.xml file is crucial to ensure that search engines can easily discover and index all product pages, categories, and any other essential sections of the site.

    - The quantity input box allows users to either type in an number (from 1-99) or use the +/- buttons to increment the quantity. These buttons are controlled by JavaScript and dynamically enable/disable when the number is at the min/max. This creates a positive user experience.

This is an essential part of the purchasing journey with lots of useful information for a shopper.

This is also the the access point for EDIT/DELETE functionality for a product for admins.

</details>

<details><summary>Add Product</summary>

- The add product page is accessible via the Site Management Page [see below](#site-management). This is restricted to site admins only. Admins can use this form to add a new product to the site and set all its information.
- The form has built in validation to make sure that all required information is provided.

- Once submitted users are directed to the product details page for that product so they can see their newly added product immediately appearing on the site. The only exception for this is if the product has been set to discontinued, in which case they are sent to the products page and an info message appears.

**Value to User**

This gives admins the ability to create edit or update a product and set all its information in a simple to use form with bespoke site styling. It is an essential part of the site management for admins.

</details>

<details><summary>Delete Product</summary>

- Admins have the ability to remove a product from the site in one of 2 ways
    - By deleting the product
        - This is only possible if the product has never been ordered. Once it has been ordered deleting it causes errors in the order history as it is associated with an OrderLineItem object. It would change the total of historic orders which would mean the business' records were incorrect. It can also cause errors in the functionality of the site.
    - By setting the product to 'discontinued'
        - This keeps the product in the database but removes it from appearing on the site. This avoids the issues listed above.

- When an admin clicks on 'delete' they are presented with a modal which is dynamically populated based on whether a product has associated OrderLineItem objects. If it is possible to delete it (ie no associated OrderLineItem objects) then they have the option to delete, if it isn't they can mark it as discontinued.
- Admins are also able to mark an object as discontinued by using the edit product form.

**Value to User**

This gives admins the ability to control their product catalogue and which products are available for sale. It means shoppers will only see products which are currently for sale.

</details>

![shopping cart](media/docs/)

</details>


<details><summary>Summary Message</summary>

- When adding, removing or updating an item in their shopping cart users are presented with a success message which includes a shopping cart summary.

    - The number of items in the shopping cart
    - Image / name / quantity for each item in the shopping cart

            - If the user is on the shopping cart page already the button takes them to the checkout page 
        

**Value to User**

The shopping cart summary gives users instant feedback on what is in their shopping cart every time they adjust its contents. It allows them to keep track of their purchases and totals, creating a positive user experience and clear information. By providing a link directly to the checkout users who are in a hurry can quickly complete their shopping, rather than having to navigate to the shopping cart page first.

</details>

<details><summary>Nav shopping cart</summary>

This creates a great user experience and smooth shopping journey.


</details>

            - Number input to manually input values (min 1 / max 99)
            - +/- buttons to increment/decrement the value
                - These buttons are handled using JavaScript & are disabled/enabled and dynamically change styling based on the min/max value in the input
            - update link to update the shopping cart after changing the quantity
            - remove link to remove the item from the shopping cart
        - Subtotal (quantity x price)
    - shopping cart total (total without delivery)
    - Delivery cost
    - Grand total (shopping cart total + delivery)
    - If the shopping cart total is less than the free delivery threshold users see a message telling them how much more they need to spend to get free delivery
    - Checkout button (button styled using 'purchasing' action blue [See Whole Site Features](#whole-site)) with a lock icon to show that the checkout is secure.
    - Keep Shopping button to return users to products page (button styled using secondary action grey [See Whole Site Features](#whole-site))
- Delivery is calculated as follows:
    - The delivery charge is 10% of the total amount spent on items that are subject to delivery
    - If a user has spent over $100 (including on products that are not subject to delivery) then delivery is free.
- If the shopping cart is empty users see a message telling them that the shopping cart has no contents with a link back to products to encourage them to shop.


**Value to User**

The shopping cart page provides users with a comprehensive breakdown of the items they have chosen so far. From here they have controls to remove & update items in their shopping cart and can see what their total cost will be with breakdown values for delivery. They can also see if they are close to the free delivery threshold which may encourage them to buy more. It gives users a great user experience with a clear responsive layout and user friendly interface.

    - A form to add delivery information
        - All fields are required apart from street_address2 & phone
    - If a user is logged in:
        - The form will be pre-populated with their profile information if previously provided
        - They can elect to update their profile information based on the form using a simple checkbox
        - The order will be saved in their profile and associated with their User object
    - If a user is not logged in they are directed to register/sign in if they wish to save their information
    - A secure payment form using Stripe as a simple, single input for card number, expiry and CVC.
        - The form comes built in with Stripe's comprehensive security and validation functionality
        - Site admins cannot access this information, it is sent to Stripe securely and the site is only notified if the payment has been successful or not.
        - Error messages below card input field
        - More information in "Checkout Process" below.
    - A Place Order button (button styled using 'purchasing' action blue [See Whole Site Features](#whole-site)) with a lock icon to show that the checkout is secure.
    - A Back to shopping cart button which takes users back to their shopping cart to amend the contents
    - A warning message that the user's card will be charged with the shopping cart total.
- The site uses webhooks to manage the functionality, listening for activity from Stripe to make sure that certain actions happen at the right times, that orders are created correctly in the database for a successful payment or not created if a payment fails. This ensures the site functions correctly, that users orders are fulfilled correctly and that payments work.

**Value to User**

A functioning checkout is a key part of an e-commerce site. This allows users to make purchases using secure payments, this is a vital aspect of the site for users who value security and want to protect their data. The use of webhooks and Stripe allows the site to function correctly, to make sure that orders are being stored correctly so that they can be fulfilled and tracked correctly by the company. The correct functioning of the company and the website relies on this working properly and it is of vital importance to both shoppers and site admins.

</details>


<details><summary>Checkout Process</summary>

- The checkout process is as follows:
    1. The user fills in their details and delivery information
    2. If any required fields are left blank attempted submission has front end validation that stops the form submitted and points out the field which has a problem
    3. The user fills in their card information
    4. If there is an error in the card details the user is notified in a message under the Stripe input either in realtime using JavaScript.
    5. The user clicks 'Place Order'
    6. The form is disabled and a loading animation appears
    7. If there is an error at this stage with the form or payment information the user is returned to the form to amend the error with an error message to tell them what the problem is.
    8. Once the order has gone through successfully the user is directed to the Checkout Success page (see below)
    9. The user sees a success message containing their order number and information about email confirmation
    10. The site sends the user a confirmation email to the email address provided
    11. An order is created in the database.

</details>

<details><summary>Checkout Success Page</summary>

- Once a successful purchase has been made the user is directed to the checkout success page.
- This page contains:
    - Order information:
        - Order number
        - Order date
        - Delivery Details
    - Order summary:
        - Product name
        - Quantity purchased
        - Total
        - Delivery charge
        - Grand total
    - Back to Shop button (button styled using 'purchasing' action blue [See Whole Site Features](#whole-site)) whilst this is not strictly a purchasing action it is the button colour that the user has been following to make their purchases, styling it blue subtly encourages them back to the store to continue that path to browse more products.


**Value to User**

This page gives the user a clear indication that their purchase has been successful, and summarises what they have bought and how much they have spent. It gives them a sense of security and that everything has functioned correctly, which is a vital part of the user experience for e-commerce sites. It also allows users to see what the next step is and to know that an email confirmation is on the way.

### Authentication

![Sign In Page](media/docs/)

#### Feature Information

<details><summary>Authentication Pages (AllAuth)</summary>

- The project uses AllAuth to implement User login and authentication functionality. AllAuth comes with a whole load of backend functionality and front end templates that make the user, registration, sign in/out and user management easy and quick to create.
- AllAuth provides a series of templates for all the actions required to implement authentication. The site uses these with its own bespoke styling to make them feel part of the site.
- All the form have been styled using the [widget-tweak](https://pypi.org/project/django-widget-tweaks/) package to add styling classes to inputs, labels and error messages from within the form templates

**Value to User**

A strong authentication system is vital to an e-commerce site, allowing users to log in, register, manage their profile, see their order history and store their data for the next time they want to make a purchase. It improves user experience and make the process of visiting the site and making purchases quicker and smoother. The styling of the forms matches the rest of site making it feel like it belongs and building confidence and trust in the site.

</details>


<details><summary>Register</summary>

- The register page allows users to set up an account
- Accessible via the account menu to logged out users
- A link to 'sign-in' is provided if a user already has an account
- Form is in the standard site bespoke form styling
- Users provide an email address (repeated to check accuracy) which is used to send a verification email
- User also provide a username and password to access the site
- AllAuth provides built in verification to check the password and username to make sure they are strong and not commonly used
- Passwords are protected and site admins cannot view them (they are hashed in the admin panel).
- If a user attempts to register with an email that is already in use the form will throw an error
- (Buttons styled using standard site button colours [See Whole Site Features](#whole-site))
    - Home button - takes user back to home page without registering
    - Sign Up - submits the form
- On successful form submission users will receive a verification email in which they must click a link to verify their email in order to sign in to their account, visiting a couple of additional pages in the process (both of which have been styled with the bespoke site styling). This provides additional security and makes sure that user emails are correct.
- Once verified users can sign in using the Sign In form with their new details.

**Value to User**

Setting up an account allows users to access benefits such as storing their information & order history for future use & creating reviews. The verification and security provided by allauth makes this a secure process for users which improves their user experience and trust in the site.

</details>

<details><summary>Sign In</summary>

- Allows users to sign in to their account
- Accessible via the account menu to logged out users
- A link to 'register' is provided if a user doesn't yet have an account
- Form is in the standard site bespoke form styling

- Users provide their account password (not visible to admins)
- There is a checkbox to tell the site to remember the user (using standard site checkbox styling).
- If an incorrect username/email & password are entered users the form fails to submit and users are shown an error message
- (Buttons styled using standard site button colours [See Whole Site Features](#whole-site))
    - Home button - takes user back to home page without registering
    - Sign Up - submits the form
- The page contains a 'forgot password' link if a user cannot log in
- On successful log in users are redirected to the home page, or, if they had previously attempted to visit a page that only logged in users could visit, they will be redirected there instead.

**Value to User**

This allows users to access their account to use their default information for purchases as well as accessing their past orders and reviews. This improves their user experience and speeds up the process of making purchases.

</details>

<details><summary>Sign Out</summary>

- Allows users to sign out of their account
- Accessible via the account menu to logged in users
- Users are taken to a page to confirm they to sign out
- Page is in the standard site bespoke styling with a button to confirm sign out
- On sign out users and their shopping cart contents are removed from the session and they are redirected to the home page


**Value to User**

The ability to sign out is an important security measure to stop other users on the same computer being able to view the user's data. This makes the site more secure and promotes trust and confidence in the site.

</details>

<details><summary>Manage Email</summary>

- The manage email page is accessible via the user profile page
- Only logged in users can access this page & users can only view their own emails
- Page is in the standard site bespoke styling with a button to add an email address
- There are 3 additional buttons for managing email actions which are styled using the site colours but are smaller to signify that they are less important actions.
- From here users can view their associated email addresses, change their primary email, re-send verification for emails and remove email addresses. They can also add additional email addresses.
- Adding a new email sends a verification to that address.
- There is a button to take users back to their profile page using the secondary grey styling.

**Value to User**

- The new password is checked for common or insecure passwords, the form will not submit if these are used and the users are shown an error message.
- This page is only for users who know their current password and wish to change it. The forgot password page is available for users who have forgotten their password and cannot sign in. (See below).

**Value to User**

This page allows users to change their current password if they are concerned about security and password management. This improves their trust in the site, the site's security and their user experience.


</details>

<details><summary>Forgot Password</summary>

- The forgot password page is accessible via the sign in page for users who attempt to sign in but cannot remember their password.
- The user is prompted to enter their email address
- If a user enters an email address that is not in the database they will be notified in an error message
- If the user enters a correct email they will be sent an email with a link to the password reset page
- Once on the password reset page the user is able to reset their password and sign in to the site with the new password but submitting another form.
- All pages are in the standard site bespoke styling with a button to submit forms, a grey home button to return to the home page and colours and fonts that reflect the rest of the site. 

**Value to User**

The ability to reset a password is very important to users who have forgotten their password, it allows them to gain access to their account data including their order history and reviews which would otherwise be inaccessible to them. It is a vital part of site authentication.

</details>

### Error Pages

![Reviews](media/docs/)


#### Feature Information

<details><summary>Error Pages</summary>

- The site has bespoke error pages for the main errors that the site might throw up (400)
- They feature a link to the home page so users can navigate back to a page that exists and works without using the nav or browser back button.

**Value to User**

This creates a positive user experience when taking an action that results in an error. It means they don't feel like they have left the site entirely and are quickly able to get back home again.

</details>

- - -

### Future Features

There are a number of features I would like to implement in the future, particularly if I were adapting this in to a real live site for an online shop as there is some functionality I feel it would really benefit from.

#### Admin Messaging System
I would like to build a messaging system, giving the site admins the ability to reply directly from the site, to be able to view the historic chain of communication, to have multiple statuses for messages e.g. in-process, and to connect messaging to the user so that users could also reply from within the site rather than via email. I would also like to add notifications to both admins and users when they receive a message, with an icon appearing in the navbar to alert them.

#### Order Tracking
I feel that an e-commerce site would also benefit from an order-tracking system which notifies admins when an order is placed and then can be tracked from within the site management area, with its status changing depending on what stage the order is at e.g. 'out for delivery' 'cancelled' etc.

#### Stock Control
I also think some sort of stock control would be useful for an e-commerce site, with products having stock supply levels and logic to hide items that are out of stock as well as notify admins when things need to be re-supplied. This would also need to be integrated with any physical shop that the owners might have and so would be a significant project.

7. Press Enter to create your local clone of the project
8. Set up your local development environment
9. Install the project requirements from the requirements.txt file in the project using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
10. Create your own env.py file containing all the required environment variables
11. You are now ready to start working on your own clone of the project - enjoy!


For more details and information go to GitHub's useful guide to [cloning repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop)

---

### Deploying Your App

Deployment allows you to transfer your project from your local environment or IDE to hosting it publicly for other people to view and enjoy. There are certain steps you will need to take to do this and they are detailed below. **These instructions are based on using an IDE like GitPod and having followed the instructions for Forking the repository above, especially installing the requirements.** For users wishing to deploy from a local clone different steps may be required which will depend on your local development environment.

#### Setting up a Database

When working on the app in GitPod a local database (sqlite) is used which will not be available on the deployed app. You will need to set up a separate database for the deployed site.

1. Go to [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) and click on 'get a managed database'
2. Select 'Tiny Turtle'
3. Sign in using your GitHub account & authorise ElephantSQL to access your GitHub account
4. Set up a team and go through the login credential process or log in if you already have an account
5. Once you are logged in name your plan (usually the project name)
6. Select your nearest region
7. If you're happy click on 'create instance'
8. Go to your dashboard (click on the ElephantSQL logo) and click on the instance name
9. Copy the database URL... you will need this for the next steps

---

#### Set up Heroku & connecting your new Database


1. Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and log in (or set up an account if you don't have one - please note you may incur charges for using Heroku)
2. Click on the 'New' button then 'create new app'
3. Name your app and select your nearest region
4. With your app set up go to the app's settings tab and under config variable click on 'reveal config variables' and add a new variable with the Key of `DATABASE_URL` and the value as the database URL that you copied from ElephantSQL
5. Back in GitPod go to settings.py and paste the following in to your DATABASE section to tell it to connect to the new database **Note - do not push your code to GitHub whilst this value is in your settings.py, it is a secret value that must not be shared, we will remove it later**

```
DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('your elephanySQL database url here'))
    }
```

6. In you GitPod terminal type `python3 manage.py showmigrations` to check you are connected to the new database, if you are you will see a list of migrations with no ticks next to them
7. Run the following command `python3 manage.py migrate` to migrate the database structure from your project to the new database
8. Any data that you have added to your SQLite database will not transfer to the new one. You will need to populate the site on the deployed app once it is up and running or using Fixtures (JSON files with all your database content) if you have them. You can find out more about Fixtures and how to use them in the [Django documentation.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/initial-data/#:~:text=you%20use%20TransactionTestCase.-,fixtures%20.,the%20manage.py%20dumpdata%20command.)
9. Create a superuser for your deployed site and new database (this will allow you to check if the database is working and access the site admin on the deployed site) using the following command in the terminal: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` and set up login details for them following the instructions.
10. Go to the ElephanySQL site, click on your database, go to the browser tab and click on 'table queries' and select 'auth_user (public)' and click on execute, you should see your newly created user.
11. You now need to remove your new database settings from settings.py and set it up to know which version of the site you are on (development or live) to know which database to use. Go back to your GitPod dashboard, click on your avatar to go your your GitPod user settings and select 'variables'
12. Add a key of DEVELOPMENT and a value of True
13. Got to your settings.py file to the DATABASES section and replace what's there with the following code (this checks to see if there is a value called DEVELOPMENT in your environment variables - ie your development environment, rather than the deployed app and sets the database accordingly.)

```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```

14. Now that you have removed your ElephantSQL database url from the settings.py file it is safe to push your code to GitHub again. Your deployed database is set up and GitPod knows which one to use for which version of the site.


#### Deploying to Heroku

1. Create a Procfile in your app in the root directory with the following content `web: gunicorn posh_portables.wsgi:application` and a blank line at the end.
2. Log in to Heroku using the GitPod terminal using the command `Heroku login`` and enter your Heroku email and password
  - if you have 2 factor authentication set up you will need to use `Heroku login -i` followed by your email and your Heroku API key as the password which you can find in your account settings on Heroku
4. Temporarily disable Heroku from collecting static files during deployment using the command `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name`
5. Commit your changes to GitHub using `git add .`, `git commit` & `git push` in the terminal
6. Then to deploy your site to Heroku use the command `git push Heroku main`
7. Your site will now be deployed without any of the static files (CSS, JavaScript & Media files)
8. In Heroku go to your app, click on activity to check if it has finished deploying and once it has go to the settings tab
9. Scroll down to 'Domains' and copy the 'your app can be found at' URL
10. Back in GitPod go to settings.py and add your deployed site's URL to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list
11. `git add .`, `git commit` & `git push` again and then `git push Heroku main` to push your changes
12. Once the site has finished deploying you should be able to navigate to the deployed site's URL and see your site content, though it will be a little strange-looking without CSS & media files!
13. You now need to replace the Django secret key in your settings.py (if you included it there) with an environment variable to keep it safe. To do this you can use a Django secret key generator online e.g. [djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/), copy the key it provides.
14. Go to your Heroku app's dashboard, open settings and reveal config variables and add a new variable with a key of SECRET_KEY and a value of what you just copied.
15. In GitPod, if you have used your secret key in settings.py, go back to your GitPod dashboard, click on your avatar to go your your GitPod user settings and select 'variables'
16. Add a key of SECRET_KEY and a value of a different Django secret key from your online key generator (djecrety or similar)
17. In settings.py and change the SECRET_KEY to `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')`
18. Below it change the value of DEBUG to the following `DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ` to dynamically change whether the app is in DEBUG mode depending on whether it is the development or deployed site
19. `git add .`, `git commit` & `git push` again and then `git push Heroku main` to push your changes
20. You can also tell Heroku to automatically deploy so you don't need to push changes to both GitHub and Heroku each time - you'll find this under the Deploy tab on your Heroku app.


#### Setting Up Your Static Files on Your Deployed Site using Amazon Web Services (AWS)

There are many options for storing your static files for a deployed site, below are the instructions for using Amazon Web Services as a cloud storage provider.

1. Create an AWS account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/) (Select a personal account for the account type). You will need to fill in your information and card details to set up an account
2. Once your account is set up and you're signed in search for s3 in the search bar
3. Click on 'create bucket' and name it to match your Heroku app, selecting your closest region and uncheck 'block all public access' then click on create bucket to set it up
4. Click on your new bucket name and go to the properties tab
5. Scroll to the bottom and click on the edit button by 'Static Website Hosting' and select 'enable', giving default values for the index and error documents (index.html & error.html) then click save changes.
6. Go to the permissions tab and copy the ARN value at the top.
7. Scroll down to the bucket policy section, select 'edit' and 'policy generator'
8. Select 'S3 bucket policy' from the dropdown
9. In principles put a * to allow all
10. Set the action to 'Get Object'
11. Paste the earlier ARN value in the ARN input
12. Click on 'add statement' then 'generate policy'
13. Copy the policy text that the generator creates
14. Back in your bucket settings (should still be open in another tab) paste the text in to the Bucket Policy empty text area then add a '/*' to the end of the resource value (which should have your bucket name in it) this will allow access to all the resources in the bucket and click save
15. Scroll down to the access control list and grant Read and Write access to Everyone (public access) by checking the boxes
16. Scroll down to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) section and paste in the following and save:

```
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

17. Go back to your AWS dashboard by clicking on the AWS logo at the top left and type in IAM in the search bar and select the IAM service
18. Click on the user groups tab and create a new group, with the name of your choice, ideally with your app name in it and create the group
19. Go to the policies tab and create a policy, go the JSON tab and search for the S3FullAccess policy and import it
20. Edit the policy to the following:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

21. Click on next and then review
22. Name the policy and give it a description and then create your policy
23. Go to the User Groups tab, select your group and go to permissions and click 'add permissions' then 'attach policy' selecting your newly created policy and clicking 'Attach policies'
24. Create a user for the group by going to the User tab and clicking 'create user'
25. Name your user (you don't need to select AWS Console access) click next and add your user to your group clicking next as required and 'create user'
26. Download and save the csv file with the user's credentials - this is important, you will not be able to access this information again
27. Back in GitPod go to your settings.py file and paste in the following code which tells the app to look for an environment variable called USE_AWS and if it's there to use the following settings to access the static files.

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'posh-portables'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
```
28. Set up the following config variables in Heroku using the information in the csv file that you downloaded:
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: *your access key value*
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: *your secret access key value*
  - USE_AWS: True
29. Remove COLLECTSTATIC from the config variables in Heroku
30. Back in GitPod create a file called custom_storages.py in the root directory and add the following:

```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

```

31. In settings.py add the following to tell it to look for the new storage classes we just created in custom_storages and to override the URLS for static and media files. Put this just below the AWS code from earlier within the if `'USE_AWS' in os.environ` statement.

```
# Static and media files
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

# Override static and media URLs in production
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

32. You're nearly there! Save your settings.py then push to add/commit/push to GitHub (if you've set up automatic deploys you won't need to also push to Heroku)
33. Once the deployment has finished check your S3 bucket, there should be a static folder in there with your static files (CSS / JS folders with files inside) and the live site should now have its CSS styling and any JavaScript functionality.
34. Finally to add your media files (images & video) simply go back to AWS, create a new folder called 'media' in the same place as the new 'static' folder, click on the folder and drag and drop all your media files in to the browser window.
35. Click next and under manage public permissions select 'grant public access to these objects' and click upload
35. Your site should now contain all your images, videos, styling and JavaScript! Well done!


#### Setting up Stripe Payments on your deployed site

1. Log in to Stripe, click on the developers tab and API keys copy the API key and set them in Heroku as config variables in the following:

- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: Stripe publishable key goes here
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Stripe secret key goes here

2. Back in Stripe set up a new webhook for your deployed site by clicking on webhooks, click on 'add endpoint' and paste in your deployed site's URL setting it to listen for all events.
3. Click on your newly set up webhook and click on 'Signing Secret' at the top to reveal the secret value. Copy it and set it as a new config variable in Heroku:
- STRIPE_WH_SECRET: Signing secret from new webhook.

## Credits

### Code

I have found many useful sources in building this project, as this has been my first Django project I have often been reliant on a lot of Googling and trawling through documentation and Slack channels. Any code that requires crediting has been mentioned within the code itself. However below are some projects which I have found useful for more general inspiration and to help me answer the more general questions about how to approach different aspects of the project:
- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) team for their [Boutique Ado](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1/tree/250e2c2b8e43cccb56b4721cd8a8bd4de6686546) project as this had a big influence on my own Posh Portables site. Parts of the code are heavily inspired by and adapted from Boutique Ado. Using Django and building an e-commerce site was a huge challenge and I was grateful to have this walkthrough to follow whilst I built my confidence on my own project, using it as a starting point to expand upon to create Posh Portables.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for general coding questions. 
- [MdBootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) for designs and code snippets.

### Content

#### Text

- [ChatGPT:](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) Used to generate text for the products, reviews, messages & FAQs to quickly populate the site so my time could be better spent on building the site and my coding knowledge. **It was not used to generate any code for the project.**
