## Planning, Design & User Experience

I approached the planning & design of this project using the principles of User Experience and the 5 stages of strategy, scope, structure, skeleton & surface. This is a large, complex project and I wanted to make sure it remained on course, on time and the best it could be whilst meeting all of the criteria for the MVP (Most Viable Product). 

### Strategy

#### Project Aims

The initial aims of the project were to create an e-commerce website for an imaginary company called Posh Portables, a gaming company who stock a variety of gaming accessories, such as laptops, monitors and headgear. The website's main purpose is to allow customers to browse the company's products and make purchases, tell the customers about Posh Portables and information about their online shop and allow user interactions through reviews and messages.

#### Research

I did some research into other similar websites as well as in the wider e-commerce world. I wanted to make sure that the Posh Portables' website conformed to the expectations that users have for an e-commerce site. This is extra important because it involves financial transactions and I wanted to create a feel of trustworthiness and professionalism in order to encourage users to make purchases. I also gathered design ideas for the look of this site including colour, layout and typography.

Websites visited for research:
- [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)
- [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/africa_en/)
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/PC-Accessories/b?ie=UTF8&node=318813011)
- [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/pc-gaming/pc-gaming-hardware/pcmcat159700050051.c?id=pcmcat159700050051)

#### User Stories

### Scope

I then created a list of all the features I would like to add to the site in order to meet all these user stories, as well as some extras that I'd like to include should time allow. I rated these in terms of difficulty and importance and this would help inform the decisions throughout the next stages of planning.
